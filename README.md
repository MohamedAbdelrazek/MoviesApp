# Popular Movies

Here is a fully functional and colorful android app which I made from scratch for Android Developer Nanodegree program.
This app reveals the power of adaptive UI both for phone and tablet devices.

*Popular Movies* was highly evaluated by certified Udacity code reviewer and was graded as "meets Specifications".

## Features

With the app, you can:
* Discover the most popular, the most rated or the highest rated movies.
* Save the most popular, the most rated or the highest rated movies locally to view them even when offline.
* Save favorite movies list locally to view them even when offline.
* Watch all trailers.
* Read  all reviews.

## How to Work with the Source

This app uses [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) API to retrieve movies.
You must provide your own API key in order to build the app. When you get it, just add the file:
    ```
    gradle.properties
    ```
  into the project,then add a string variable with your api_key ___ the Format will be like this
    ```
    API_KEY="Your api_key"
    ```
